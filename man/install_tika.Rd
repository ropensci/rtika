\description{
This downloads and installs the Tika App \code{jar} (~60 MB) into a user directory,
and verifies the integrity of the file using a checksum.
The default settings should work fine.
}
\section{Details}{

The default settings of \code{install_tika()} should typically be left as they are.

This function will download the version of the Tika \code{jar} tested to work
with this package, and can verify file integrity using a checksum.

It will normally download from a random Apache mirror.
If the mirror fails,
it tries the archive at \code{http://archive.apache.org/dist/tika/}.
You can also enter a value for \code{url} directly to override this.

It will download into a directory determined
by \code{tools::R_user_dir("rtika", which = "data")},
specific to the operating system.

If \code{tika()} is stopping with an error compalining about the \code{jar},
try running \code{install_tika()} again.
}

\section{Uninstalling}{

If you are uninstalling the entire \code{rtika} package
and want to remove the Tika App \code{jar} also,
run:

 \code{unlink(tools::R_user_dir("rtika", which = "data"), recursive = TRUE)}

Alternately, navigate to the install folder and delete it manually.
It is the file path returned by 
\code{tools::R_user_dir("rtika", which = "data")}.
The path is OS specific.
